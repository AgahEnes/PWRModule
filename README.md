# PWRModule
In this article we introduce our power distribution modules. These boards help to get rid of long and heavy power cables. Circuit boards are reliable for connection instead of cables. Some of them distribute power to parallel or serial ways and others regulates high voltage power to desired values.
 PCB's have XT60 connector inputs for battery and XT60 outputs to power sensors or other kind of stuffs on our UAVs. Every output connection getting power from Li-Po battery and regulate this for desired value. By using resistors we adjust the out voltage. Both of the boards for our UAVs and for regulate power.
 One of them designed for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and is capable of meeting the power requirements of the onboard sensors and autopilot. There is also a motor drive system that will enable the UAG to move.
